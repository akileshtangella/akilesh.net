I"<p>DAI is an Ethereum based ERC20 token. The purpose of DAI is that at all points in time, its price should be equal to 1 US Dollar (USD). This is known as being pegged to the dollar. The price of a conventional ERC20 token is determined by supply and demand on the open market. This leads to unpredictable price volatility. So how does the DAI, despite being traded on the open market, kill this price volatility, and instead stay pegged to the USD. In this article, we answer these questions.</p>

<h2 id="arbitrage">Arbitrage</h2>
<p>Suppose a token is traded on two exchanges, \(A\) and \(B\). Suppose for simplicity, there are no transaction fees. Let the tokenâ€™s price on exchange \(A\) be \(P_A\) and its price on exchange \(B\) be \(P_B\). We claim that the \(P_A = P_B\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this is not true and \(P_A &lt; P_B\). An opportunistic trader will buy tokens on exchange \(A\) and sell them on \(B\), thus making a profit. This will occur until the \(P_A\) and \(P_B\) converge.</p>
