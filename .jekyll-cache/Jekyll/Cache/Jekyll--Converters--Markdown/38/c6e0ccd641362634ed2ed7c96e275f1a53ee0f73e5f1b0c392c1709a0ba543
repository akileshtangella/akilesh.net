Particularly, we show a toy solution for the <strong>Automated Accounting, Triple-Entry Bookkeeping, Streaming Financials</strong> problem.</p>

<p>The code corresponding to this blog post is on Github <a href="">here</a>. The code uses Solidity, TypeScript, and the Hardhat Ethereum development environment.</p>
