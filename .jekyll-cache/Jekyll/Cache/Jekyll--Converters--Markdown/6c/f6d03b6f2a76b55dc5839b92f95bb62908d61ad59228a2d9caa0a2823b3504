I"[<p>DAI is an Ethereum based ERC20 token. The purpose of DAI is that at all points in time, its price should be equal to 1 US Dollar (USD). This is known as being pegged to the dollar.

So how does the DAI, despite being traded on the open market, kill this price volatility, and instead stay pegged to the USD. In this article, we answer these questions.</p>
