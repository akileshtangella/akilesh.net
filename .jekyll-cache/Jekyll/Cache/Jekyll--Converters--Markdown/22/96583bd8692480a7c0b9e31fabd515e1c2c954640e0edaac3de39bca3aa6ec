I"i<p>DAI is an Ethereum based ERC20 token. The purpose of DAI is that at all points in time, its value should be equal to 1 US Dollar (USD). The price of a conventional ERC20 token is determined by supply and demand. This leads to unpredictable price volatility. This is something DAI cannot have, as its price must track the US dollar at all points in time.</p>
